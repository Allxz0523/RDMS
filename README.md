# Introduction:

This is the source code of the ICDE 2024 paper (submitted) “Managing the Future: Route Planning Influence Evaluation in Transportation Systems”. Please refer to the paper for the algorithm details.

# Algorithm:

The following codes contain the data preparation, simulation, and update operation. "main.cpp" contains the code to run all these operations. Please follow the comments inside to convert the parameters.

# Data:

All the data are stored in the data folder. Only 10K route data are contained because of data privacy.

# Dependency:

g++ and boost.

All the codes are runnable after make.
